Resources exploring money, the functions of money, the problems with existing forms of money and how demurrage represents a promising solution that could be adopted across Web3 ecosystems.



**Credits**

The resources from the money section are heavily inspired from the [video course](https://silviogesell.com/video-course/) presented by the [Silvio Gesell Foundation](https://silviogesell.com/). Most of those resources are entirely based on the content covered in the video course. To learn more about Gesellâ€™s background, ideas and economic perspectives please consider watching their video course.
