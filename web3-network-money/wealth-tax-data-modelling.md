# Wealth tax data modelling

A number of comparisons can be made to better understand the implications of adopting a wealth tax within a Web3 network.

The approaches we want to compare are as follows:

* **Hoardable money & added transaction fees generating treasury income** - The money doesn’t lose value over time and the base transaction fee is increased to generate ongoing income for the ecosystem treasury.
* **Hoardable money & excess transaction fees generating treasury income** - The money doesn’t lose value over time and the transaction fees are as low as possible with only excess fees being used as treasury income that are above the compensation threshold for node operators.
* **Demurrage money & 0.1% wealth tax** - The money simulates the effects of demurrage using a 0.1% wealth tax.
* **Demurrage money & 1% wealth tax** - The money simulates the effects of demurrage using a 1% wealth tax.

The data model applies some examples values to illustrate the difference between these approaches based on whether the user is a hoarder, an active user or a combination of the two. The data modelling can be found here:

## Key takeaways



**Hoardable networks are great for hoarders and bad for active users**

The most important users for a Web3 network are those that actually use the network and generate economic activity. Those that just hoard the network coin are generating no activity and are limiting other peoples access to the network money. A hoardable network means that hoarders will pay nothing towards supporting the network. Only active users will pay for fees that support the network. Active users are unfairly punished with a larger financial burden as the fees to maintain the network are only split across those that are actively using the network and not those that are hoarding the network money and not submitting transactions.



**Generating treasury income with added transaction fees punishes active users**

If treasury income is generated through active users this is a form punishment for active users as they now would also be the only ones that are paying towards the treasury. Hoarders of the network money wouldn’t need to contribute towards the treasury. This approach leads to the worst outcome for active users as it is the most expensive approach for them to use the network regularly. This creates an incentive to use other networks where the transaction fees are lower. A hoardable network that only generates treasury income from excess transaction fees solves this problem however now the income potential for the treasury could be drastically reduced if transaction fees are being reduced as much as possible.



**Hoardable networks could have transaction fees that are as cheap as demurrage networks**

If node operators are paid a fixed amount it wouldn’t matter if it was a hoardable network or a wealth tax based network for keeping transaction fees low. This is because a hoardable network could adopt a certain transaction fee amount until a threshold amount of income is achieved and then lower the transaction fee amount once that threshold is exceeded. This example is not demonstrated in the data model however it is a feasible implementation. Hoardable networks still have the problem that the transaction fees might initially be higher until this threshold is met which could punish poorer users. Wealth tax based networks would still be preferable as it spreads the cost of paying for node operators across the entire network of people that hold the coin rather than just the active users.



**Wealth tax networks will need to add additional incentives or have sufficient network effects to maintain a high wealth tax**

A wealth tax network could be easily duplicated and the wealth tax could be reduced to only pay for the node operation. When these networks mature there will be less development effort required to improve and maintain the network. This situation creates an opportunity to reduce the wealth tax or for other networks to duplicate the network and reduce it themselves.

This could make it difficult to keep the wealth tax above the cost of operating the network unless an additional incentive is added to generate demand ongoing for the network money. Alternatively network effects could help with preventing people from leaving the network due to the difficulties in getting everyone to migrate elsewhere.
