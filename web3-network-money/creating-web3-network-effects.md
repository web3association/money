# Creating Web3 network effects

Network effects refer to the phenomenon where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. Network effects could be an effective way to retain users in a Web3 network and prevent them from migrating to other competing networks. Network effects could play a very important role in sustaining a higher wealth tax due to the difficulty for other networks to gain enough traction because of the network effects that already exist for the most adopted ecosystem.



## Approaches for creating network effects



**Token asset adoption**

A large amount of token based assets being created and used on a single network could create a network effect where people continue to use that network due to the easier access to assets they want to own and use.

This approach is only somewhat compelling as the technology for interoperability keeps improving and these networks are commonly open and permissionless. It will likely become increasingly easy to migrate an asset to another network if there was an incentive to do so.



**User adoption**

Global adoption of a Web3 network where many people use and rely on that network could create a network effect due to the ease, trust and familiarity of using that network. It could take a large amount of effort to incentivise and convince people to use another network if the existing one fulfils their needs.

This approach is only somewhat compelling as increasingly automated solutions could exist that take advantage of using the most cost effective networks. Even a small community of people might be able to benefit from another network where the incentives are better aligned for their use cases.



**User application data**

As a Web3 network grows the number of protocols and applications that exist on that network should grow with it. User data that is stored in these protocols and applications could represent another potential network effect as this usage data helps to strengthen the connection between the user and the network.

This approach is not massively compelling as if the protocols and applications are open source and permissionless their data should be self sovereignly owned. This would make it easy enough for people to migrate their existing data to other applications if there was an incentive to do so.



**Group application data**

Applications that involve groups of people could create a more sticky environment as it could require a consensus from that group of people to migrate to another network. Each of the users in that group rely on the data that is being created and managed in the existing application. Example group applications could be collaboration tools or group communication.

This approach is slightly more compelling than user applications as a group of users often need to act in unison rather than a single user independently making a decision themselves. However it still might not be very difficult to migrate to another network due to the open and permissionless nature of the networks. The exact same application and data could be copied across to another network with some better aligned incentives.



**Commerce adoption**

A growing number of businesses that accept the network money or token assets for buying goods and services could create a network effect of adoption for conducting commerce.

This isn’t very compelling for creating a reliable network effect as businesses could accept the same token but from other networks or they could accept other forms of money entirely along with the ones they already do. They don’t rely on other businesses to do this for them to decide to take this initiative. However it is worth noting that businesses would likely be concerned with whether these alternative forms of money are sufficiently reliable and stable.



**Identity credentials adoption**

Self sovereign identity solutions could become widely adopted in a Web3 network and the credentials people use in their wallets could help with making the network more sticky.

This isn’t a very compelling approach as self sovereign identity wallets should enable people to move their credentials to other wallets, assuming the data is truly self sovereign! This means other networks and wallets could gain adoption fairly easily due to the open and permissionless nature of this identity technology.



**Identity connection data**

Each identity wallet could have connections with other wallets such as peer reviews, endorsements, friend or professional based connection information or collaboration history. The data that exists between each identity could create a network effect that makes it difficult to move to other networks.

This is only somewhat compelling as self sovereign identity solutions can work across multiple networks as the standards can be universally adopted and integrated. Identities and credentials can migrate to other networks. Decentralised identifier (DID) implementations are tied to specific blockchains. Some users may decide to replace the existing DID’s they’ve used in a renewed credential, however this still might add a level of risk or complexity to handle this migration. So this factor could add at least some amount of network effects that prevent people from migrating to other networks.



**Mediation services adoption**

Web3 technology can be used as an effective tool for removing middlemen for many different services. But this doesn’t negate the importance of third party mediators from being involved when something goes wrong. An example could be a marketplace where the buyer puts their money into an escrow contract and the seller receives the funds after some form of proof of delivery. The buyer might want to contest the exchange and state the item was not delivered. This is where a mediation service could be used to resolve the problem. Building up a network of these mediators could create a certain level of stickiness for using one network over another as it would take time to build up this ecosystem of mediators.

This approach is only somewhat compelling as although there is increased value from having a larger amount of mediators on one network it doesn’t prevent mediators from being signed up and available in multiple places. Protocols that handle this mediation process could also potentially work across multiple networks. That outcome would remove most of the friction of using one network over another.



**Financial liquidity**

A large amount of deposited liquidity that is being used productively in a network can create a much more sticky market due to the efficiencies that a large amount of liquidity can create. Financial liquidity might also be locked up for a period of time to generate higher yields such as through loans or exchange liquidity based incentives.

Financial liquidity could represent a highly effective network effect as each individual would be contributing a certain amount of liquidity into the network. If only a few people tried moving towards another network they would not easily be able to compete with the most dominant network that already has the largest amount of liquidity. The largest network should have the most efficient markets which makes it more desirable to use the financial services available in this network.



## Most promising solutions

Financial liquidity is the most compelling solution for creating network effects for the Web3 networks that are trying to compete as a digital asset network. Liquidity provided by a wide range of users can help to create a more sticky and highly efficient market for facilitating exchange.

The other approaches identified above were not massively compelling on their own. This was mostly due to the open and permissionless nature of Web3 networks that make it easier for people to migrate to other networks. However, a combination of the approaches mentioned above do still represent a fairly compelling network effect. In combination these approaches could result in a higher overall complexity and cost to migrate to other networks, making it less compelling to switch to another network without a very good reason to do so. If these factors are effective in combination it could help with sustaining a larger wealth tax as the other networks may still struggle to compete with the combination of network effects that might exist. If these were effective it would be highly desirable for the dominant network as it could mean the network is able to more easily sustain a sufficiently high wealth tax to improve the network and wider ecosystem as well as to fund other global public goods.
