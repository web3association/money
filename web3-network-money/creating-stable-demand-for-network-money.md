# Creating stable demand for network money

Demurrage creates an incentive for people to not hold the money due to the loss of value over time. This incentive can be problematic for digital currencies due to the speed and ease of exchanging money for any other asset that doesn’t lose value over time. Without any incentives to generate ongoing demand there is a risk that demurrage could result in a lower price for the network money due to the constant sell pressure from people exchanging the network money for other assets.



## Physical money vs digital money

Physical money, like gold, coins and banknotes have different characteristics when compared to digital money. Physical money means people would need to exchange or invest their money in person with other people. This means there would always be some period of time where they are holding money that they receive before then meeting with another person that they want to exchange with. The process of exchange and investment would be slower and more gradual with a physical monetary system. It is more inconvenient to hold multiple forms of physical money to conduct exchange. So the issue around creating demand for a demurrage physical money would be less than a digital money.

Digital money is entirely different. With digital money, people can find out about goods and services online and find out the prices immediately and what forms of money the seller accepts. The buyer can exchange the money they have for something else almost instantaneously. Systems could also be created to automate the process of exchanging any money you receive into other assets the moment you receive digital money. Implementing a demurrage money would create an incentive for these solutions to be developed that handle this for you. People are incentivised to hold other assets if the money they are holding is losing value. Anyone will be able to do this in any way they can. People may still use the money to exchange and invest in businesses but they would only want to hold that money at the exact moment they are going to perform those actions. Outside of this they would likely prefer to hold something that will appreciate in value or retain its value like a digital gold representation or another similar type of asset.

Web3 money is programmable. The networks are increasingly becoming cheaper and faster. Introducing a wealth tax would create an incentive for people to avoid holding the network money until it was absolutely necessary to use it. This would create an ongoing amount of sell pressure for the network money due to this incentive. If no one wants to hold the money this could limit its price potential and overall value. People might accept the money during exchange but then immediately exchange it for another asset that doesn’t lose value. Limited price value of the network money could put the security of the network at risk as it is the network coin that is often used to influence governance and funding decisions in the network. Any of the assets and functionality that get built on top of the network could be highly valuable. Network money that has minimal demand could increase the opportunity for someone to quickly attain a large amount of that network money and then attempt to maliciously attack the network.

Introducing incentives could be an important part of maintaining stable demand for network money. In the later growth stages of these networks, where coin velocity becomes an increasingly important factor, there will be an ongoing need to sustain a sufficient level of demand for the network money.



## **Undesirable outcomes**



**Hoarding the network money**

It is not desirable for anyone to hoard a large amount of the network money for any extended period of time. The network money always needs to remain liquid enough so that money is available for people that need to use it and pay for network fees. The incentives to generate demand shouldn’t encourage the excessive hoarding of network money.



**Little demand for the network money**

Only implementing a solution for demurrage could result in an ongoing amount of sell pressure. If the network money is used for network governance and funding decisions it will be important that enough demand exists for the network's money as otherwise it will be easier to accumulate the money and maliciously influence or attack the network.



**Short term demand for network money**

The problem with transaction fee based demand is it is very short term. The demand for the money only happens at the point of the transaction and there is little reason to hold it beyond this. A network needs to think about how it can incentivise long term demand for the network money so that the price can remain more stable as the demand for transactions can drastically change over time.



**Loss of taxation value**

Low demand for the network money is also problematic for limiting the value of any income that is generated for the treasury. The network money could be quickly sold by anyone that receives the network money from the treasury or from anyone else. This could make it more difficult to fund meaningful initiatives if the value of the network money is always suppressed due to constant sell pressure.



**Money not being used productively**

Creating incentives to just hold the coin to generate demand is undesirable as this means the money would be sitting idle instead of being used productively. It would make more sense to incentivise people to deposit the network money as financial liquidity so that it is used more productively.



## Approaches for generating demand for network money



**Decrease the wealth tax**

Decreasing the wealth tax would simply mean the network is changing from a demurrage based network to a hoardable one. This leads to all the problems with adopting hoardable money so we’re actively trying to minimise the need to reduce the wealth tax.



**Transaction fee reduction incentive**

Users could pay a higher transaction fee by default. An incentive that could generate longer term demand for the network money would be one that encourages people to deposit network money as liquidity and if they do this they could receive cheaper transaction fees. This incentive would be useful for transferring demand for transaction fees into financial liquidity. It would not likely create much new demand for the network money beyond transaction demand but it would create more long term demand for network money instead of only short term transaction demand.

As an example, if someone submitted 1000 transactions annually and those cost $0.01 each this would equate to $10 worth of transaction fees. So offering this user an incentive to receive half price transaction fees would only be worth $5 to this user. This means the incentive would need to ask for less than this for it to be a viable incentive. For instance, the incentive could be to deposit $4 of liquidity to receive the reduction in transaction fees that is worth $5.



**Token asset transaction fees or token asset wealth taxes**

The network could try to increase the demand for the network money by making the other assets in the ecosystem less appealing to hold. Increasing the asset based transaction fees is one approach. Another is to introduce a wealth tax that is applied to all token assets.

These approaches are unnecessary as having other forms of money on the network does not compromise the need of the network money. Network money is always needed for transaction fees and is also well suited for being used as financial liquidity. If demurrage was forced upon all assets in the network it would mean that no asset could have the store of value property. This would make other networks much more appealing and competitive as they could simply give the users this optionality around adopting the exact properties they want for their tokens.



**Wealth tax reduction incentive**

Users could pay a higher wealth tax amount by default when they are holding network money in their wallet. This wealth tax could then be reduced if they deposit the money as financial liquidity. This is desirable as it means that unproductive money is now being used productively. One of the worst outcomes for network money is that it is sat idle and not being used productively for things like financial liquidity or for transaction fees. This would help to increase the overall productivity of the network money.



**Transaction speed reduction incentive**

Users that deposit financial liquidity could benefit from prioritised transactions. This is problematic as it gives wealthier users an advantage over poorer users as they could benefit from faster transactions. Poor users would have an incentive to adopt other networks that don’t adopt this approach.



**Subscription based access**

Users could be required to subscribe to the network by paying a fee. This is problematic as it punishes the poorest users who may not have enough to pay for this fee. Poor users would have an incentive to adopt other networks where they can use it without paying a subscription fee.



**Restricted feature access incentive**

Access to features could be restricted to those that have provided liquidity into the ecosystem. This incentive wold likely require some minimum threshold of liquidity. This is problematic as it punishes poorer users as they won’t be able to benefit from the same functionality as wealthier users. Poor users would have an incentive to adopt other networks.



**Governance participation incentive**

The ability to participate in governance decisions could be determined by whether someone has deposited a certain amount of liquidity or not. This is problematic as it disincentivises people from participating in governance which could centralise control of the network into the hands of people that are willing and able to pay to participate.



**Treasury participation incentive**

The ability to participate in treasury decisions could be determined by whether someone has deposited a certain amount of liquidity or not. This is problematic as other people will still be contributing towards the network's treasury through fees and taxes yet they might not get to influence how that is going to be used. Someone else could be making a decision about how their own contributions are being spent!



**External initiatives & incentives**

A number of different initiatives and incentives could be introduced that are handled outside of the network. Some examples could be reduced national taxes for people that deposit liquidity in the network or legislation that incentivises the use of approved networks such as those that adopt a certain percentage of wealth tax to properly simulate demurrage. It is difficult to enforce these types of solutions properly as the network is global and each country competes with one another. So if these initiatives created a reason for people to move to other countries it could create an incentive to not adopt those ideas in the first place. Although these example ideas might not be compelling they might still be somewhat effective and there could still be other external incentive approaches that can be considered.



## Most promising solutions

Financial liquidity incentives such as the transaction fee reduction one or a wealth tax reduction one to prevent people from leaving network money idle could be two example incentives that help to ensure that network money is used more productively. If the network money is the primary money used for token asset exchanges this is a valuable use case that can sustain demand for the network money.

An incentive to deposit money as liquidity into financial protocols means the network can benefit from the network money being increasingly used for either transaction fees or as financial liquidity. These two use cases are highly valuable for the network. Idle and unproductive network money is the least desirable outcome and a liquidity incentive can help to minimise that issue. Liquidity incentives can also help with creating longer term demand for the network money.

Many of the other incentive ideas were not compelling as they would often mean punishing poor users unnecessarily as they would be required to deposit liquidity to get some form of reward such as feature access, lower transaction fees, quicker transactions, network governance access or treasury governance access. Other networks could simply duplicate the network and remove this incentive which could give many people a reason to migrate to this other network.

External initiatives and incentives may be possible for increasing the amount of demand for network money. However it is not clear whether these ideas would ever be reliable enough. It is much more desirable for any incentives to be handled by the network itself if they are going to be more predictable and reliable over the long term.
