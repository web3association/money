# Creating stable demand for network money

Demurrage creates an incentive for people to not hold the money due to the loss of value over time. This incentive can be problematic for digital currencies due to the speed and ease of exchanging money for any other asset that doesn’t lose value over time. Without any incentives to generate ongoing demand there is a risk that demurrage could cause a low price for the network money due to the constant sell pressure from people that sell the network money for other assets.



## Physical money vs digital money

Physical money, like gold, coins and banknotes, don’t have the same issue with needing to generate demand for holding the money due to the characteristics of physical money. If people used physical money they would need to exchange or invest that money in person with other people. This means there would always be some period of time where they are holding the money they receive before they then meet with another person that they want to exchange with. The process of exchange and investment would naturally be more gradual with a physical monetary system.

Digital money is entirely different. With digital money, people can exchange the money they have for something else instantaneously. Systems could be created to automate the process of exchanging any money you receive into other assets the moment you receive digital money. Implementing a demurrage money means an incentive is created for these solutions to be developed. People are incentivised to hold other assets if the money they are holding is losing value. Anyone will be able to do this in any way they can. People may still use the money to exchange and invest but they would only want to hold that money at the exact moment they are going to perform those actions. Outside of this they would likely prefer to hold something that will appreciate in value or retain its value like a digital gold based token or something similar.

Web3 money is programmable. The networks are increasingly becoming cheaper and faster. Introducing a wealth tax would create an incentive for people to avoid holding the network money until it was absolutely necessary to use it. This would create an ongoing amount of sell pressure for the network money due to this incentive. If no one wants to hold the money this could limit its price potential and overall value. People might accept the money during exchange but then immediately exchange it for another asset that doesn’t lose value. Limited price value of the network money could put the security of the network at risk as it is the network coin that is often used to influence governance and funding decisions in the network. Any of the assets and functionality that get built on top of the network could be highly valuable. Network money that has minimal demand could increase the opportunity for someone to quickly attain a large amount of that network money and then attempt to maliciously attack the network.

Introducing incentives could be an important part of maintaining stable demand for network money. In the later growth stages of these networks, where coin velocity becomes an increasingly important factor, there will be an ongoing need to sustain a level of demand for the network money.



## **Undesirable outcomes & behaviours**



**Hoarding large amounts of the network money**

It is not desirable for anyone to hoard a large amount of the network money for any extended period of time. The network money always needs to remain liquid enough so that money is available for people that need to use it and pay for network fees. The incentives to generate demand shouldn’t encourage the hoarding of network money.



**Little demand for the network money**

Only implementing a solution for demurrage could result in an ongoing amount of sell pressure. If the network money is used for network governance and funding decisions it will be important that enough demand exists for the network's money as otherwise it will be easier to accumulate the money and maliciously influence or attack the network.



**Loss of taxation value**

Low demand for the network money is also problematic for limiting the value of any income that is generated for the treasury. The network money could be quickly sold by holders of the money and also by people that receive the network money from the treasury. This could make it more difficult to fund meaningful initiatives if the value of the network money is always suppressed due to constant sell pressure.



## Approaches for generating network money demand



**Increase transaction fees**

Decreasing the wealth tax and then increasing transaction fees would make it more desirable to hold the network money. But this is obviously very undesirable as it leads to transaction deadweight loss due to higher transaction fees and makes it more viable to just hoard the network money.



**Token asset transaction fees or wealth taxes**

The network could try to increase the demand for the network money by making the other assets in the ecosystem less appealing to hold. Increasing the asset based transaction fees is one approach. Another is to introduce a wealth tax that is applied to token assets. These approaches are unnecessary as having other forms of money on the network does not compromise the need and value of the network money. Network money is always needed for transaction fees and is highly suitable for token asset exchange liquidity. If demurrage was forced upon all assets in the network it would mean that no asset could have the store of value property. This would make other networks more appealing and competitive as they would give the users more optionality on the exact properties they want their tokens to have.



**Minimum coin holding incentive**

An incentive could be introduced to encourage people to hold a very small amount of the network money. They could receive a benefit for doing so such as reduced transaction fees.

In terms of implementation the network could be highly specific on the amount of demand it is looking to generate for the network money. For instance, if it wanted to target 50% of the network money being held in wallets it could divide the available supply by the active wallets and then divide that number by two to get a 50% target amount that people could be incentivised to hold. As the number of active users increases or decreases the amount of network money that each person needs to hold could dynamically change over time. This makes for a self correcting system based on any growth or contractions. A minimum holding incentive would help to incentivise the ongoing demand for network money.

The problem with this approach is it is not a productive use of the network money. It would just be sitting idle in the wallets and providing no value to the network economy. Although this approach would work for generating stable demand, it fails in using it productively.



**Token asset exchange liquidity incentive**

Web3 networks make it easy to create tokens that could represent any physical or digital asset. Users can compete with each other in making a more desirable medium of exchange. The network money could be paired up with any of these tokens as exchange liquidity. An incentive could be introduced that encourages people to deposit network money into an exchange with a token pairing of their choice. This would create ongoing and stable demand for the network money and also would mean that the network money is being used productively. If this was the main incentive that created stable demand for the network money it could help with ensuring that the network money is also the primary and most effective money for facilitating token exchange. Focussing on just this incentive could help with creating deep liquidity pairings that make the market more liquid and efficient. In terms of implementation, there are many ways that the complexity of this process could be streamlined and automated for the end user. For instance, an index of token pairings could be used or third party services could emerge that handle this complexity for the user.

A token asset exchange liquidity incentive is a highly desirable approach for generating long term stable demand for the network money whilst also productively using the network money by increasing the efficiency of token exchange markets due to amount of liquidity that could be deposited due to this incentive.
