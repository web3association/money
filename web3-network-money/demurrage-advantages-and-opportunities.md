# Demurrage advantages & opportunities

There are a number of advantages and opportunities for Web3 ecosystems that adopt demurrage via a network coin tax. Demurrage helps to improve any Web3 ecosystem's system of money. And it is also advantageous for the network, its treasury and society more broadly.



## **Money**

The following are general advantages that are applicable to any system of money that adopts demurrage.



**Increased money velocity**

Implementing demurrage would help with increasing the velocity of money due to the incentives it creates for users to not leave money idle in their wallet. The longer that someone holds demurrage money in their wallet the more money they will lose due to demurrage. For Web3 networks this will likely be due to a network coin tax. Users are incentivised to do something productive with the money rather than just hold it, such as by purchasing goods or services or investing it into business ventures.



**Smaller money supply changes**

Systems of money could benefit from having a certain supply change mechanism that is suited to their use cases, such as fixed, expansionary, contractionary or elastic. These money supply change systems may be automatically adjusting, which is desirable to avoid the need for community governance at a global scale. Demurrage can help with improving the systems around supply changes as it can help with increasing the velocity of money. Higher velocity should mean that even small supply changes are more effective at impacting economic activity in the network. Increases in the supply of money should be under the same impulse and incentives for it to be used productively due to the effects of demurrage. Demurrage and higher coin velocity within a Web3 ecosystem should help with reducing the number of size of any money supply changes.



**Incentivises productive money usage**

If users don’t leave their coins idle in their wallet, due to the incentives created by demurrage, they will need to find a place to spend or invest that money. Demurrage could help with persistently increasing the amount of economic activity that occurs in the network. Every holder of money would have an incentive to put it to better use rather than just hold it. Increasing the amount of economic exchange is desirable as it means someone's goods or services are being paid for and those sellers can then use that income to either provide more goods and services, invest it or use it elsewhere in the economy. Investments are highly beneficial for economic activity as now someone who might not have been working is now given the opportunity to contribute towards the economy and start providing their own goods or services. The ongoing incentives created by demurrage can help with lowering the prices of goods and services and making a more competitive market due to the ongoing incentive for people to either exchange or invest their money. Demurrage also helps to reduce the marginal efficiency of money as capital, which increases the number of investment opportunities that now become viable due to them now representing a better return on investment than simply saving the network coin.



**Easier access to money**

People that don’t have much money could greatly benefit from demurrage. Demurrage would increase the demand for labour as it increases the number of business ventures that become viable. As an example, a farmer might be interested in growing mango trees. This investment might only breakeven or generate a small return on investment. This business opportunity might only become viable thanks to the adoption of demurrage. The investor would benefit from not losing money by just holding their coins. And the farmer growing mango tree’s benefits from getting access to the capital that will help them start their business. Without demurrage this investment might not have ever occurred. But thanks to demurrage the whole economy benefits from easier access to money that can help with starting a new business.



**Reduce money based inequality**

If someone receives interest from simply holding or staking the network coin there is a strong likelihood that inequality in coin ownership will increase over time. Any form of storable money could generate positive and risk free interest due to the fact it can be lent out in a single asset borrowing and lending protocol. The amount of interest they can earn would obviously vary however it would be a positive rate of return.

Let’s consider a 1% interest rate, which could be received due to something such as staking rewards or single asset borrowing and lending. A person holding $1 million worth of the network coin would receive $10,000 in interest each year. If they are able to live off less than that amount they reach escape velocity where they can perpetually increase their money position each year without contributing anything to the economy. Demurrage prevents this likely inevitability as instead of gaining 1% each year they would be losing 1%. Now it gets harder and harder to retain large amounts of the network coin over the long term thanks to demurrage. A positive interest rate for holding or using the network coin in a risk free manner is an example of unearned income - someone would be receiving income without contributing anything to the economy. Demurrage helps to reduce these issues around unearned income.



## **Network**



**Increased coin decentralisation**

Creating incentives for people to exchange or invest their money rather than leave it idle and store it is highly beneficial for a Web3 network. If people were incentivised and rewarded for storing, you could expect to see some individuals eventually reach economic escape velocity where they can easily live off the interest they generate from just storing the money they have whilst also increasing their coin holdings in perpetuity. In these situations, people can become increasingly wealthy over generations without contributing much value or economic activity to the network.

In a Web3 network this wealth could also translate into more economic and governance influence in the network. Wealthy individuals may attain an ever increasing amount of influence and power in the network. This outcome could be catastrophic for the network over the long term and lead to systemic failure. Demurrage helps to prevent this outcome by removing the incentive to store the network money for long periods of time. Under a network coin tax, the larger the amount of coins someone holds the more they would lose to taxation. It therefore becomes harder to retain large amounts of money due to the loss from demurrage. Demurrage can help with increasing the amount of dispersion of the network coin, which helps with increasing decentralisation and spreading any power and influence across the network. Demurrage helps to greatly reduce the likelihood of power concentrating into the hands of a few people, an outcome that is often inevitable with storable forms of money.



**Node operator income stability**

A network coin tax could either subsidise or fully pay for the operational costs of running a node. This means transaction fees could be reduced or even potentially removed in the future. This would make the network more competitive in the market. A network coin tax is an ongoing tax which can generate predictable treasury income. It represents a long term solution for keeping transaction fees as low as possible whilst also generating income for node operators that is more reliable and predictable.



**Flexible supply change mechanisms**

Demurrage when implemented as a network coin tax does not involve any constraints on how the supply of money is handled. Web3 networks could implement a network coin tax and then adopt any approach for making supply changes. These include fixed, expansionary, contractionary or elastic supply models. For example, for an elastic supply mechanism, a network could introduce more coins into the network via the treasury and then remove some of the supply from the income that is generated by the network coin tax.



**Efficient financial markets**

If the value of the network coin was mostly or fully derived from its usage for transaction fees it could make the value of the coin more volatile due to a changing amount of demand for transactions. Multiple sources of demand is a desirable outcome to try and resolve this problem.

An opportunity with applying demurrage to Web3 networks is how a coin taxation rate could be applied. The taxation rate could be different in different contexts. It could be higher when the coin is sitting idle in a wallet and lower when it is deposited in a financial protocol. A more granular approach to applying the network coin tax creates an opportunity to create more highly efficient financial markets by incentivising people to use the network coin as productively as possible.

The network coin could be used as token exchange liquidity or as lending and borrowing liquidity as some examples. These use cases could help with better maintaining stable prices for the network coin over the long term. The network coin could be entirely focussed on being used for either transaction fees or as financial liquidity. The more effective the network coin is at facilitating token exchanges the more efficient the network's token market becomes. Efficient financial markets should be an effective way to increase the network effects of the network. Stable network coin prices can also help to increase the price stability of any income generated from taxation, income that can then be used to pay for node operators and other ecosystem initiatives.



## **Treasury**



**Ecosystem funding**

The income generated by a network coin tax would be reliable and predictable for funding ecosystem initiatives that introduce new use cases or that improve the network's infrastructure. Even a small percentage tax rate could generate a meaningful amount of income that helps to maintain and improve a Web3 network. Network coin taxes would be charged periodically such as every day and this frequent taxation amount would be a very small percentage. Over a year the aggregate taxation value would represent the annual percentage tax rate. The exact amount of income would be known ahead of time due to it coming from the existing supply. This predictability is beneficial as it can be taken into account when planning and funding any larger initiatives that could benefit the network.



**Accelerate ecosystem growth**

The network coin tax could dramatically help with increasing the ecosystem's rate of growth. The founding entities first need to prove that the funding process they develop is sufficiently effective at improving, maintaining and growing the ecosystem. If the return on investment from the funding process is higher than the cost it would likely be beneficial to increase the coin tax rate. The higher the coin tax rate the larger the amount of funding that will become collected for incentivising ecosystem development. Holders of the network coin might lose more coins from the network coin tax but they could benefit from much faster coin price appreciation due to the initiatives that get developed due to the funding process. Web3 networks operate in highly competitive markets, so increasing the growth rate of the ecosystem would likely be highly desirable due to the opportunity to rapidly increase any network effects faster than the competition.



## Society



**Global public goods funding**

A network coin tax creates a massive opportunity to fund large scale and highly impactful global public goods initiatives. If a large and consistent amount of funding is available for funding the ecosystem's own development there are two key reasons why an increasing amount of funding could become available for global public goods over the long term.

The first reason is that the ecosystem will eventually start to mature and this could mean it requires less funding for development efforts. This is not to say that funding will become no longer necessary, as research efforts would likely always be valuable for exploring even small potential improvements to the network. Instead, what might happen is the financial requirement for network development could plateau and stabilise instead of needing to continuously grow alongside the network.

The second reason more funding should inevitably become available is that if the ecosystem is successful, the value of the ecosystem should grow over time. This means that even a small percentage network coin tax could equate to a large and growing amount of available funding. For instance an annual 1% network coin tax for a $10 billion ecosystem would mean $100 million in treasury income each year. For a $1 trillion ecosystem this would mean $10 billion each year. A network coin tax should lead to an increasing likelihood that global public goods could be funded using that income.

This is a huge opportunity for society, Web3 networks and their funding process could create highly aligned incentives for people to get funded to work on global public goods. High performing contributors could be paid extremely well and their contribution efforts could be directed towards highly impactful initiatives that globally benefit society.

Engineering, scientific, medical and environmental based research and development efforts are just a handful of example areas that could be well funded through a Web3 networks funding process over the long term. Demurrage via a network coin tax represents a massive opportunity to create one of the largest and most effective funding processes for global public goods that has ever been conceived.
