# Responsibility comparison

The network coin and tokens have a number of responsibilities they will need to handle. Let’s take a look at which responsibilities are most suitable for each type of asset.



## Network governance



**Network coin**

A Web3 network only needs to be governed by one type of fungible asset - commonly the network coin. There are alternative approaches for handling network governance, such as attempting one person one vote, however this is often problematic due to sybil resistance issues and that with Web3 networks no one is forced to use a particular network over another one. Anyone can create or migrate to other networks at any time they like. So the one person one vote approach would mean that people that don’t have the best intentions for the network would receive equal voting power as someone who has contributed with a large amount of investments, fees and taxes towards the network. The network coin could be a valuable part of determining voting power for any networks governance process as people would need to contribute towards the network by investing capital to acquire the network coin.

The network coin could also be used to help with governing the networks monetary policies concerning any coin changes such as supply changes. Voting power could be influenced by how much of the network coin people hold or what tax contributions they have made. Keeping governance processes as simple as possible will be desirable for any Web3 network. However simplicity will be even more important for the network coin due to the increased voting complexity of handling a global user base.



**Tokens**

Tokens don't have the responsibility to maintain the network itself. Similar to the network coin, tokens could be used to determine the amount of voting power someone has for a governance process that manages the token as a system of money. This could be for money supply changes or any other monetary policy change. The complexity for governing the system of money could be similar for the network coin and tokens as they could adopt similar approaches. However overall, the network coin should commonly have more governance responsibilities than token money as it could also be used to manage the network itself. So overall, tokens might have the simpler governance processes due to the lack of the network related responsibility for tokens.



## **Network operation**



**Network coin**

The network coin is highly suitable for paying for the operational costs of the network. Users would pay transaction fees or other forms of taxes using the network coin. This income can then be used to pay for node operators or for other ecosystem initiatives. Web3 networks can create circular economies that incentivise people to operate nodes that maintain the network.



**Tokens**

Tokens could be used to pay for node operators however there are a number of security risks to consider. If the tokens are created by a subset of the community there is a risk about how that community could change the monetary policies of that token to benefit themselves or for trying to harm the network. The network needs to be as robust and resilient as possible. If the network is going to be adopted at global scale there is little room for enabling any opportunity for systemic failures. Using community made tokens to operate the network could introduce more risks than there are benefits due to the unpredictability of how those tokens are governed. There is also uncertainty around whether each token adopts suitable functions and properties, as this could influence whether there might be any long term problems or not, such as the risk around increasing wealth concentration over time.



## Financial liquidity



**Network coin**

The network coin is highly suitable for being used as financial liquidity such as for token exchange pairings as it is an asset that everyone already uses and needs to pay for network usage. The network coin could become the primary exchange pairing for different tokens. This could help to reduce the number of swaps that people need to make when swapping one token for any other token. If multiple forms of money were used for these exchange pairings it could increase the number of swaps that are necessary to execute certain token exchanges. This could create fragmented liquidity due to the problem of tokens being spread across numerous liquidity pairings due to the usage of many forms of money. The network coin could be a highly suitable candidate as a primary form of liquidity for facilitating token exchanges.



**Tokens**

Tokens could also be used as financial liquidity, such as for facilitating token exchange, though it would be beneficial if there was only one primary pairing against the other tokens. This would mean that if a token was used as the primary pairing, it would benefit from being globally governed by the ecosystem to manage how it is going to be used for token exchanges. So tokens could still be a viable candidate as a primary token exchange pairing however  the network coin is already a highly suitable candidate to fulfil this role.

Communities that create their own form of money may also want to create localised exchanges. In these exchanges their own tokens could be paired up with other token assets that are more specific and relevant to the community itself. So although the responsibility of token exchange liquidity could be globally handled by the network coin it could also be locally handled by token money within each community to facilitate more specific and localised use cases.



## Medium of exchange



**Network coin**

The network coin will be one of the most adopted and widely known forms of money in the network. The broad acceptance and adoption of the network coin could make it suitable as a potential medium of exchange. However this doesn’t mean that the network coin should be used as a medium of exchange. Web3 networks are commonly intended to be global and permissionless networks. The network coin needs to be always available so it can facilitate the exchange process. If the network coin was adopted as a global medium of exchange it would likely need to take on the added responsibility of maintaining stable prices. If prices are not stable this can have a negative impact on economic activity. People may make quick decisions due to price uncertainty. They could start acting on the belief that the money could quickly lose or gain value. For instance, if people believe it might gain value in the short term, they may decide to store it, as then it should become cheaper to buy goods and services in the future. If the money supply needs to be adjusted to improve the system of money as a medium of exchange it could be highly challenging to do so with a large global population of users that depend on it. Those changes would need to be beneficial for the majority of the users. A global network of users would need to be involved in any governance decisions to change the network's monetary policy. Web3 networks need to prioritise simplicity and reliability in the design of the network to minimise the chance that the network could systematically fail. Trying to make the network coin a global medium of exchange is an unnecessary complexity that could increase the risk that the network systemically fails in the future.



**Tokens**

Web3 networks create an open and permissionless free market for mediums of exchange to compete with one another. Communities can create a medium of exchange that is context specific and purpose built for their community and environment. For instance, each country could create their own medium of exchange and adapt the money supply and mechanics of that money as necessary to ensure prices remain stable. This could help to prevent the problems that would more likely occur if a global medium of exchange was adopted, where different economies would likely have different growth rates and requirements. Web3 networks help to enable ongoing competition between different mediums of exchange, so many new ideas for systems of money could be experimented with using tokens. This makes token based money highly suitable for creating a medium of exchange that people use day to day. Governance decisions can also be handled much more quickly and efficiently with a token money approach, as these communities are able to create and locally govern the money themselves.



## Store of value



**Network coin**

Web3 networks could become increasingly responsible for a very large population of users from across the world. This means that these networks will need to be far less lenient on people storing the network coin for future use as people would increasingly depend on access to this money to use the network. Therefore it will be important to balance the demand for the network coin with enough influence from demurrage to prevent it from being left idle for long periods of time. Although the network coin shouldn’t be a good store of value it also doesn’t need to be something that loses value at a fast rate.

The network coin will benefit from being as precise as possible with how much demand exists for the coin and how the coin is actually being used. Digital asset networks will fiercely compete with other networks to create the best environment for creating, exchanging, using and storing digital assets. It is this competition that will likely limit how high the rate of demurrage can be for the network coin. Web3 networks will likely rely on network effects to maintain a sufficiently high rate of demurrage.



**Tokens**

Tokens have much more flexibility to decide how it should be implemented. Tokens could be created for any community large and small. Some communities may prefer a system of money where the user can hold a small amount of it but beyond that point it starts charging them a demurrage fee. Although potentially desirable, this type of implementation would have sybil attack risks as people could split their holdings across multiple wallets to not pay the demurrage fee. Identity solutions could help to potentially prevent this problem and in that event these types of ideas could then be implemented. This is just an example, however it makes it easier to see how large the scope is in regards to how many ideas could be experimented with.

Although the store of value property is not a desirable one for creating an effective system of money there are still many opportunities to explore different implementations of tokens. Communities could experiment with different approaches for implementing their own system of money that have different tolerances for the store of value property under different conditions.
