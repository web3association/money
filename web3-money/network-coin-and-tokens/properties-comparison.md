# Properties comparison

The network coin and tokens have different properties that need to be considered when thinking about how demurrage might be applied to each type of asset. For this comparison we’re assuming that both the network coin and tokens are adopting the same monetary policy, meaning they could both be storable where neither of them lose value over time or they could both adopt the same rate of demurrage. The main question we want to answer is which type of asset is going to be more desirable to use and hold due to their inherent properties and what this could mean when implementing demurrage within these potential systems of money.



## Acceptance & awareness



**Network coin**

The network coin would be one of the most widely accepted fungible assets in the world if a network is able to gain global adoption. Everyone that uses the network would need the network coin to pay for transaction fees. There might only be a few networks that achieve this scale. In that event, the awareness about these networks and the network coin would be even higher. The network coin should generally have a larger amount of acceptance and awareness than any implementation of token based money.



**Tokens**

The market for token based money would be far more competitive. No one is forced to use one token over another and many types of token money could exist on a single network. People might accept many forms of token money when conducting exchange. Tokens could still have a large amount of acceptance and awareness however they still might struggle to become as broadly accepted as the network coin due to the fact that users require the network coin to use the network however they are not required to use any implementation of a token.



## Competition



**Network coin**

New networks can emerge and compete with the existing ones however these networks could achieve a higher level of network effects once they have scaled and succeeded. If there is little to improve upon by creating a new network it becomes less likely that a new network will be able to compete with ones that have already been widely adopted. So competition could become a decreasing factor for the network coin over the long term as these networks continue to gain more global adoption.



**Tokens**

Tokens would likely have a larger amount of ongoing competition over the long term due to the simplicity and ease of creating new tokens. New ideas and approaches can easily be experimented with, meaning existing implementations of money using tokens will likely need to adopt the best ideas if they want to remain relevant and desirable as systems of money. People might even adopt one form of money over others due to personal values and preferences rather than the merits of the technical implementation. This factor only increases the potential for long term competition.



## Demand



**Network coin**

For the most successful networks there would always be an ongoing amount of demand for the network coin as it will be used to pay for network usage such as through transaction fees. If the network is implemented as simply as possible the network coin should be highly reliable and secure, which can further add to the demand for the network coin due to these properties.



**Tokens**

People aren’t forced to adopt any implementation of token based money. They also don’t need to use just one form of money. People might decide to use multiple tokens to minimise the risk of loss in case any of them fails. Demand for token based money is never guaranteed and it could be split across multiple forms of money. Any ongoing competition between different types of token could make it difficult to sustain long term demand for a single form of token money due to the high levels of competition.



## Financial collateral



**Network coin**

The global adoption of these networks should benefit the network coin in becoming an effective form of financial collateral that is used across the network. Everyone has demand for the network coin as it pays for network usage. This makes it a desirable choice for also using it in financial protocols as collateral as everyone knows there is long term demand for the network coin and they know it's less likely it will suddenly fail or disappear. The network coin can provides a more reliable guarantee that it can sustain longer term value when compared to tokens. Tokens could more easily be replaced by a new competing solution. This could make the network coin the more desirable form of financial collateral.



**Tokens**

Token based money could still be highly effective as a form of financial collateral, especially in the communities where that money has been developed specifically for their use cases. Token money could also be adopted globally, which could increase its utility and value as a form of liquidity across many financial protocols. However the demand for token money is never guaranteed and the competition with other forms of token based money could limit the adoption of these tokens due to the limited reliability in terms of demand. There is more certainty in the long term demand for the network coin, which is why it might often be a safer choice as financial collateral.



## Flexibility



**Network coin**

Web3 networks will likely be adopted at a global scale and this scale leads to a requirement of minimising the networks complexity wherever possible due to the challenge, risks and cost of governance and maintenance involved at a global scale. Web3 networks will benefit from simple and elegant solutions for governing the networks system of money - such as implementing automated solutions that are self correcting. Generally speaking, the simpler and more automated the network and the network coin is the better.



**Tokens**

Tokens can be more flexible in how it is implemented due to a smaller community that it will be commonly used for. The network coin will likely be adopted by a global population. Token based money might only be adopted by a single nation state, online community or online gaming ecosystem. Token based money could be implemented in a way that is much more context specific to the needs of that community. This greater amount of flexibility in how the system of money can be implemented and governed could come at a cost of introducing risks around who has influence and control over the parameters of that system. It can also raise concern around how malicious attackers could take advantage of the implementation and any governance process. Token based money could also be implemented in a way that is as simple as possible to avoid these risks. So the implementation and governance complexity is not necessarily any higher than with the network coin. Implementations for tokens could be simpler but this can make the system of money more rigid and inflexible to change.



## Predictability



**Network coin**

A globally adopted Web3 network needs to be as simple and resilient as possible if it is going to be reliable and robust over the long term. The network coin has more of a requirement to be as predictable as possible as this can help with increasing the amount of trust people have in the network and how it operates. The network coin that is governed and managed by a global population would mean that a large amount of time and effort could be required to make any decisions due to the sheer scale of the number of people involved. This reality of global scale will often mean the network coin needs to be more simple and predictable. It would be expensive and time consuming to make any governance decisions when a global population of users is involved.



**Tokens**

The smaller the community the quicker it could be for them to make decisions and change a token based system of money. This can make token based money less predictable in how it might change over time unless they have made the token immutable by design. Making the token immutable would make it more predictable but this could come at the cost of losing implementation flexibility. Some implementations of token based forms of money could be more predictable and even simpler than the network coin. Tokens have more flexibility in how they could be implemented when they are adopted in smaller communities.



## Price stability & appreciation



**Network coin**

The network coin will struggle to maintain stable prices due to global adoption and usage. Trying to change the supply of the network coin to accurately respond to growth of the global economy is complex and could introduce a number of systemic risks for the network. The network coin benefits from remaining as simple as possible to reduce these risks. If the economy slowly grew over time and the supply of the network coin was fixed the price of the network coin would eventually increase over time as the coin would likely be split across an increasing number of people, goods and services and use cases.



**Tokens**

Tokens are able to focus on the more specific requirements of the communities that adopt token based money. Nation state countries could continue to govern their own form of money. In these localised geographic areas it becomes easier to maintain stable prices as there are less variables to be concerned about when changing the supply of money. This makes it easier to maintain stable prices in response to changing economic factors. Tokens should be able to maintain stable prices more easily than the network coin as tokens do not need to be responsible for a global economy and global user base. Tokens could also have a simple monetary policy. If tokens have a fixed money supply it could see ongoing price appreciation as the economy grows. Adopting this supply approach would mean the token would not be as effective at maintaining stable prices.



## Summary

The network coin would likely be the more desirable asset to hold and use when compared to tokens if the monetary policies were the same. The network coin would have a larger amount of global acceptance and awareness. It would have more guaranteed demand for the coin due to it being required for any transaction fees. If a network achieves global scale and network effects this can also mean that the network coin faces weaker ongoing competition than tokens. The sustained demand for the network coin also helps it become an effective form of financial collateral due to the higher certainty that it will be in demand and valuable in the future.

Generally speaking the network coin is far less flexible than tokens in how it can be implemented. This is due to the global scale that it needs to handle, which means that the network coin needs to be as simple and predictable as possible. This simplicity and predictability can make the network coin a desirable form of money to store, as it should be more reliable and simply governed. Nothing prevents tokens from adopting similar implementation approaches, or potentially even simpler ones. So these factors don’t reliably make the network coin anymore desirable than tokens.

A key difference with the network coin and tokens is the flexibility tokens have to be implemented in different ways. Countries could manage their own token based money and more easily maintain stable prices due to the more limited amount of data and variables they need to consider. The network coin does not have this simplicity as it will likely be adopted across the globe, which can make it harder for it to maintain stable prices due to the complexity of the global economy and how it can quickly change over time.

Overall the properties of the network coin can often make it a much more desirable asset to hold when the network coin and tokens have similar monetary policies. This increases the potential risks and concerns around how the network coin could become increasingly stagnant over time due to its desirable properties that make it more likely that people leave it idle and store it for future use.

The network coin will need to effectively incentivise people to use it more productively or to use other forms of money for use cases such as a medium of exchange. To make tokens more appealing it could be important that the network coin maintains a higher rate of demurrage than what is being used for tokens. If not, tokens would likely need some added incentives or system properties that make it more desirable than the network coin over the long term to make them more appealing to use.
